### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gary! Welcome to my Github repository!

I am a Technical Architect, my technical journey is about helping build and support systems that apply to business needs and our everyday life. 

I currently support cloud technologies specializing in [Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/#overview) for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/).

I look forward to reaching and helping more people by sharing my knowledge.
